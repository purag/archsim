# Assembler & Emulator for CSE 141L

To see the assembly code, check out the files `141prog1.js`, `141prog2.js`, and `141prog3.js`.

To assemble them, type `node 141prog1.js asm` (replace `141prog1` with the one you wish to assemble).

To run the assembly programs, use `node 141prog1.js run`. Same as above for the other two.
